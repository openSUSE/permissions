# This file is used by chkstat (and indirectly by various RPM scripts)
# to check or set the modes and ownerships of files and directories in the installation.
#
# There is a set of files with similar meaning in a SUSE installation:
# /usr/share/permissions/permissions  (This file)
# /usr/share/permissions/permissions.easy
# /usr/share/permissions/permissions.secure
# /usr/share/permissions/permissions.paranoid
# /etc/permissions.local
# Please see the respective files for their meaning.
#
#
# Format:
# <file> <owner>:<group> <permission>
#
# How it works:
# To change an entry copy the line to permissions.local, modify it
# to suit your needs and call "chkstat --system"
#
# chkstat uses the variable PERMISSION_SECURITY from
# /etc/sysconfig/security to determine which security level to
# apply.
# In addition to the central files listed above the directory
# /usr/share/permissions/permissions.d/ can contain permission files
# that belong to the packages they modify file modes for. These
# permission files are to switch between conflicting file modes of
# the same file paths in different packages (popular example:
# sendmail and postfix, path /usr/sbin/sendmail).
