# After editing this file run
#	chkstat --system --set
# to apply the changes.
#
# This file is used by chkstat (and indirectly by various RPM package scripts)
# to check or set the modes and ownerships of files and directories in
# the installation.
#
# If you want chkstat to be run automatically after zypper operations, then
# you can install the permissions-zypp-plugin. This is helpful when you are
# entering permissions in this file that get overwritten by package updates.
# The plugin keeps the custom permissions in place.
#
# In particular, this file will not be touched during an upgrade of the
# installation. It is designed to be a placeholder for local
# additions by the administrator of the system to reflect filemodes
# of locally installed packages or to override file permissions as
# shipped with the distribution.
#
# Format:
# <file> <owner>:<group> <permission>
#
# Please see the file /etc/permissions for general usage hints of the
# /etc/permissions* files.
# Please remember that logfiles might be modified by the logfile
# rotation facilities (e.g. logrotate) so settings entered here might
# be overridden. Also devices files (/dev/*) are not static but
# managed via udev so this file can't be used to modify device
# permissions either.

# suexec is only secure if the document root doesn't contain files
# writeable by wwwrun. Make sure you have a safe server setup
